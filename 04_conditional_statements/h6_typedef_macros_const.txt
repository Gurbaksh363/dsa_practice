Question 6:
typedev vs macros vs const

1) typedef keyword: in C++ is used for aliasing existing data types, user-defined data
types, and pointers to a more meaningful name.
Eg: typedef int mylnt
This allows us to declare new integers using mylnt, instead of int.

2) Macros: can be of any type. Macros can even be any code block containing
statements, loops, function calls etc. They are expanded by the preprocessor before
compilation takes place.

3) const: keyword is used to define the constant value that cannot change during
program execution.
